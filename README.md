# RISC-V 32-bit ALU Design and Verification

## Overview
This project features the design and verification of a synthesizable 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit  as a key component of a RISC-V CPU.

The project showcases hardware design using SystemVerilog, along with testbench development and functional verification leveraging Python-based cocotb. Simulations are performed with open-source tools including Icarus Verilog and Verilator.

## Features
- 32-bit ALU supporting operations: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, and others
- Fully synthesizable RTL code in SystemVerilog
- Comprehensive automated testbench using cocotb for functional verification
- Simulation and waveform generation with Icarus Verilog and Verilator
- Manual environment setup and debugging to ensure reliable test execution

## Tools and Technologies
- SystemVerilog  
-  Python, cocotb  
- Icarus Verilog, Verilator  
- Git, GitHub
